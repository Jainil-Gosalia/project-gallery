# Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio repository! Here, you'll find a collection of my projects and contributions in various areas, including software development, machine learning, and AI.

## About

This portfolio showcases my work, highlighting:

- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: This folder covers implementations of machine learning algorithms from scratch, testing assumptions of any machine learning algorithm and their practical usage on real world data.
- **Deep Learning:** This folder explores some of the deep learning algorithms and how they are implemented on synthetic data as well as messy real world data.
- **Generative AI:** This folder features implementations of generative AI models, exploring core concepts, training methods, and real-world applications in data and content generation.
